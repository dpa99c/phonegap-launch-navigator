## v3.0.0
Version 3 is a complete rewrite of the plugin in order to support launching of 3rd party navigation apps on Android and iOS.
The plugin API has changed significantly, but is backwardly-compatible to support the version 2 API syntax.

If for any reason you have issues with v3, the final release of v2 is on this branch: [https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator/tree/v2](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator/tree/v2). It can be specified in a Cordova project as `uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator@2`.

[cordova-plugin-actionsheet](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-actionsheet) has been introduced as a plugin dependency.
It is used to display a native picker (both on Android and iOS) to choose which available navigation app should be used. This is used if [app](#app) is specified as `launchnavigator.APP.USER_SELECT`, which is the default in v3 if an app is not explicitly specified.
