Launch Navigator Cordova/Phonegap Plugin
=================================

This Cordova/Phonegap plugin can be used to navigate to a destination using the native navigation app on:

- Android: Google Navigator
- iOS: Apple Maps/Google Maps<sup>[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
- Windows Phone: Bing Maps

<sub><a id="fn1">[1]</a>: on iOS, you can choose to [prefer Google Maps](#ios) over Apple Maps if it's installed on the user's device; if not, Apple Maps will be used instead.</sub>

# Installing

## Automatically with CLI / Plugman

Launch Navigator can be installed with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman) and the [PhoneGap CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_cli_index.md.html).

Here's how to install it with the CLI:


    $ cordova plugin add uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator

OR

    $ phonegap plugin add uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator

## PhoneGap Build

Add the following xml to your config.xml to use the latest version of this plugin from on [plugins.cordova.io](http://plugins.cordova.io):

    <gap:plugin name="uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator" source="plugins.cordova.io" />


# Using the plugin

The plugin has single function which launches the navigation app with the location specified as the destination.

    launchnavigator.navigate(destination, start, successCallback, errorCallback, options);

## Parameters

- destination (required): destination location to use for navigation, either as a String specifying the place name, or as an Array specifying latitude/longitude.
- start (optional): start location to use for navigation, either as a String specifying the place name, or as an Array specifying latitude/longitude. If not specified, the current device location will be used.
- successFn (optional): Called when plugin the call is successful.
- errorFn (optional): Called when plugin encounters an error. This callback function will be passed an error message string as the first parameter.
- options (optional): Platform-specific options. See [Caveats](#caveats) for details on each platform.

## Example usage

Navigate by place name:

    launchnavigator.navigate(
      "London, UK",
      "Manchester, UK",
      function(){
          alert("Plugin success");
      },
      function(error){
          alert("Plugin error: "+ error);
      });

Navigate by latitude/longitude:

    launchnavigator.navigate(
      [50.279306, -5.163158],
      [50.342847, -4.749904],
      function(){
          alert("Plugin success");
      },
      function(error){
          alert("Plugin error: "+ error);
      });

Navigate from current location:

    launchnavigator.navigate(
      "London, UK",
      null,
      function(){
          alert("Plugin success");
      },
      function(error){
          alert("Plugin error: "+ error);
      });

### Example project

https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator-example

The above link is to an example Cordova 3 project which demonstrates usage of this plugin.
The examples currently run on Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows 8.1 (PC) platforms.

## Deprecated functions

The old version of this plugin provided two separate functions in order to specify the destination either by name: `navigateByPlaceName` or by lat/lon: `navigateByLatLon`
These functions are still present in the plugin for backward compatibility, but are deprecated in favour of using the `navigate()` and may be removed in a future version of the plugin.


# Caveats

## Windows

- The plugin is compatible with Windows 8.1 on any PC and on Windows Phone 8.1 using the Universal .Net project generated by Cordova: `cordova platform add windows`

- Bing Maps will require the user to press the enter key to initiate navigation if you don't provide the start location.

- If the start location is not passed via the plugin, Bing Maps does not automatically use the current location of the user (as Android and iOS do).
However, the [Geolocation plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation) can be used to find the current location of the user, for example:

        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(pos) {
          launchnavigator.navigate(
            "London, UK",
            [pos.coords.latitude, pos.coords.longitude],
            function(){
                alert("Plugin success");
            },
            function(error){
                alert("Plugin error: "+ error);
            });
        });

## iOS

- The iOS version of the plugin supports the following platform-specific options:
  - {Boolean} preferGoogleMaps - if true, plugin will attempt to launch Google Maps instead of Apple Maps. If Google Maps is not available, it will fall back to Apple Maps.
  - {Boolean} enableDebug - if true, debug log output will be generated by the plugin

For example:

    launchnavigator.navigate(
      "London, UK",
      "Manchester, UK",
      function(){
        alert("Plugin success");
      },
      function(error){
        alert("Plugin error: "+ error);
      },
      {
        preferGoogleMaps: true,
        enableDebug: true
    });

- If possible, test using the [example project](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator-example) to eliminate the possibility of a bug in your code rather than the plugin.


When reporting issues, please give the following information:

- A clear description of the problem

- OS version(s) and device (or emulator) model(s) on which the problem was observed

- Code example of calling the plugin which results in the observed issue
